# Flappy_Bird_Game

### The game is written in Python using the Pygame module.

### The game consists of a bird that flies between two pipes. The player controls the bird by pressing the up arrow key or the space bar to make it flap its wings.

### The pipes move from the top of the screen to the bottom. If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game ends.

### The player's score is incremented for each pipe that the bird passes through without hitting it.

### The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the ground. The player can then restart the game by pressing the enter key.

### Here are some additional features that you could add to your game:

### 1. Different types of pipes, such as pipes that are wider or narrower, or pipes that have gaps in them.
### 2. Different backgrounds, such as a forest background or a city background.
### 3. Different sounds, such as a flapping sound when the bird flaps its wings or a crashing sound when the bird hits a pipe.
### 4. A high score leaderboard so that players can compete with each other.
